Smart Route Planner - Shortest Path Finder using Dijkstra's Algorithm


About the Project

Smart Route Planner is a web-based application that efficiently calculates the shortest path between two points using Dijkstra's Algorithm. It features an interactive graph visualization and a modern UI built with Angular and Material Design.

This project demonstrates expertise in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) while integrating a powerful tech stack:

Backend: Java + Spring Boot (REST APIs for graph processing)

Frontend: Angular, ngx-graph (for graph visualization), Angular Material

Algorithm: Dijkstra's Algorithm for shortest path calculation

Perfect for showcasing problem-solving skills and full-stack expertise!
